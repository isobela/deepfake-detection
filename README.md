# Deepfake Detection project

For this deepfake detection project, I designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to distinguish between real and altered media. Using a dataset from Kaggle, 
I started with data preprocessing, applying OpenCV to normalize and resize images for consistent training. 
I then built a CNN optimized for image classification, enabling accurate detection of fake faces.
